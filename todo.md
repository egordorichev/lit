# todo

* test..call()..smth()

* check how syncing works
* command line args (get them in the actual lit script), command line input, color printing
* make var statements into expressions to allow stuff like if (var a = test()) { print(a) }
* emit_pop_continue needs to work with nested loops
* opcode saving/loading
 + file std library
 + allow to require modules using local path from the module path (module path + require_path)

* creating fibers, yielding and trying & throwing exceptions
* resizeable stack

# feature creep

* switch statement?
