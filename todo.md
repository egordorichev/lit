# todo

* update readme with proper example links (and docs links)

* if argument expected type doesnt match in native function, like require, it will crash (cuz it still continues to operate)
* check how syncing works
* table with globals? module.exported? module.privates?
* resizeable stack
* ffi?

* make var statements into expressions to allow stuff like if (var a = test()) { print(a) }
* emit_pop_continue needs to work with nested loops
* opcode saving/loading

# feature creep

* switch statement?
* # unary? (length or square root?)
