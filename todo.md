# todo

* compile/run multiple files

* optimizations {
 * unused locals / privates
 * constant folding
 * while loops with false condition
 * multiplication by 1
 * optimization levels
 * tail-call optimization?
}

* benchmarks
* update readme with proper example links (and docs links)
* enums
* html5 version auto-build & demo

* if argument expected type doesnt match in native function, like require, it will crash (cuz it still continues to operate)
* check how syncing works
* table with globals? module.privates?
* resizeable stack
* ffi?

* make var statements into expressions to allow stuff like if (var a = test()) { print(a) }
* emit_pop_continue needs to work with nested loops

# feature creep

* switch statement?
