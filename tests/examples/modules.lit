 * You can require other lit files at any time. Require is just a function, so you can pass generated

 *
 * Lit will add path to the current module with the module name, that you provide, and look there.
 * It searches for either .lit or .lbc (compiled lit bytecode file).
 * If it doesn't find them there, it will try to take your words literally.
