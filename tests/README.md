Welcome to the most important (and defenitely not boring) folder of lit.
It houses tests and examples. Both things can help you learn the languge, but where I tried to make examples
more humanly readable and easy to understand, tests can be more on the weird side. 

So, if you are looking to start, head into the [examples](https://github.com/egordorichev/lit/tree/master/tests/examples)!
